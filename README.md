# Assessment-Marks-Module
Using python and its data structures this project is developed to manage the user account and users marks.

This Project uses simple inhouse database which is created by dictionaries and does not link to an external database.

The software has a set of predefined users at the start of the program 
however this can be changed and new users can be added whose account details are stored in the inhouse database
